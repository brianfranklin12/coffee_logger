# Coffee Logger

Coffee Logger is a web app for collecting detailed data on coffee brewing, allowing the user to record information about their recipe, grind size, rating, notes etc. The goal of Coffee Logger is to help the user in the pursuit of brewing the most delicious cups of coffee they can!

## Usage
[Click to visit the site!](https://coffee-logger.netlify.app/)

Click the 'Add a New Coffee' button to add a coffee to this list. To log details of a specific brew, click on the row of the coffee you want to log and you'll be directed to that coffee's logs. Once there, you can click the 'Add New Log' button and enter in any details of the coffee's brew that you want to track! The back button will bring you back to the list of coffees. Hit the small 'x' on the end of the rows to delete any coffee that you don't want to keep record of anymore.
